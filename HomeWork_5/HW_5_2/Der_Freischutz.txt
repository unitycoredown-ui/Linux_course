Act II, Scene Finale: The Wolf's Glen

(A wild, rocky gorge. A waterfall. A storm is brewing. The moon is sometimes visible, sometimes obscured by racing black clouds. Kaspar is preparing the magic bullets.)

MAX
(Appearing at the top of the gorge, descending slowly and fearfully)
The path ends here! The abyss yawns beneath me!
Is this the place? The eerie silence of the grave
reigns here. Oh, horrible night!
What ghostly shapes loom in the shadows?
Is that a face, grinning there in the darkness?
No! It was nothing! Just my fearful heart!
Courage, Max! You must go through with this!
For Agathe! For a future with her!

(He reaches the bottom. A clock in the distance begins to strike.)

KASPAR
(Barely visible in the gloom)
You've come. Good. The time is right.
The witching hour approaches. Everything is prepared.
Remember, from this moment on, not a word of prayer!
Or all is lost—for you, and for your soul.

MAX
(A shudder running through him)
Then let it be quick. I can barely stand this place.

KASPAR
(Begins to draw a magic circle)
First, we must banish the holy elements.
We call upon the powers of the earth and hell!
The lead for the bullets comes not from a mine,
but from a roof, struck by lightning!
The bullets must be cast in this circle, here.
Now, help me summon him.

MAX
Whom do you mean to summon?

KASPAR
(His voice dropping to a whisper)
He who provides the aim. The Black Huntsman himself.

(Kaspar throws a black powder into the fire. Flames leap up, green and sulphurous. The stage is plunged into an infernal glow. Spectral shapes begin to appear.)

CHORUS OF INVISIBLE SPIRITS
(Echoing from the rocks and the air)
Uhui! Uhui!
Who comes so late through night and wind?
Who dares to tread this accursed ground?
Uhui!

(The figure of Samiel, the Black Huntsman, appears suddenly, standing on a rock.)

SAMIEL
I am here. Who calls me from my rest?
The price is known. The seventh bullet is mine to guide.
To whom does it belong?

(He looks directly at Max. Max recoils in terror.)

KASPAR
(Gesturing to Max)
To him! It is for him!

SAMIEL
(A grim smile)
So be it. Begin the casting.
Beware the seventh!

(Samiel vanishes. A wild, supernatural storm erupts. The casting of the seven bullets begins amidst visions of a ghostly hunt, crashing thunder, and demonic laughter.)
