act ii scene finale the wolfs glen

a wild rocky gorge a waterfall a storm is brewing the moon is sometimes visible sometimes obscured by racing black clouds kaspar is preparing the magic bullets

max
appearing at the top of the gorge descending slowly and fearfully
the path ends here the abyss yawns beneath me
is this the place the eerie silence of the grave
reigns here oh horrible night
what ghostly shapes loom in the shadows
is that a face grinning there in the darkness
no it was nothing just my fearful heart
courage max you must go through with this
for agathe for a future with her

he reaches the bottom a clock in the distance begins to strike

kaspar
barely visible in the gloom
youve come good the time is right
the witching hour approaches everything is prepared
remember from this moment on not a word of prayer
or all is lostfor you and for your soul

max
a shudder running through him
then let it be quick i can barely stand this place

kaspar
begins to draw a magic circle
first we must banish the holy elements
we call upon the powers of the earth and hell
the lead for the bullets comes not from a mine
but from a roof struck by lightning
the bullets must be cast in this circle here
now help me summon him

max
whom do you mean to summon

kaspar
his voice dropping to a whisper
he who provides the aim the black huntsman himself

kaspar throws a black powder into the fire flames leap up green and sulphurous the stage is plunged into an infernal glow spectral shapes begin to appear

chorus of invisible spirits
echoing from the rocks and the air
uhui uhui
who comes so late through night and wind
who dares to tread this accursed ground
uhui

the figure of samiel the black huntsman appears suddenly standing on a rock

samiel
i am here who calls me from my rest
the price is known the seventh bullet is mine to guide
to whom does it belong

he looks directly at max max recoils in terror

kaspar
gesturing to max
to him it is for him

samiel
a grim smile
so be it begin the casting
beware the seventh

samiel vanishes a wild supernatural storm erupts the casting of the seven bullets begins amidst visions of a ghostly hunt crashing thunder and demonic laughter
